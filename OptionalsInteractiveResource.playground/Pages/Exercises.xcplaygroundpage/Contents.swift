## Exercises

 ### Exercise - Optionals
 Imagine you have an app that asks the user to enter his/her age using the keyboard. When your app allows a user to input text, what is captured for you is given as a `String`. However, you want to store this information as an `Int`. Is it possible for the user to make a mistake and for the input to not match the type you want to store?

 Declare a constant `userInputAge` of type `String` and assign it "34e" to simulate a typo while typing age. Then declare a constant `userAge` of type `Int` and set its value using the `Int` initializer that takes an instance of `String` as input. Pass in `userInputAge` as the argument for the initializer. What error do you get?
 */


//:  Go back and change the type of `userAge` to `Int?`, and print the value of `userAge`. Why is `userAge`'s value `nil`? Provide your answer in a comment or print statement below.


/*:
 Now go back and fix the typo on the value of `userInputAge`. Is there anything about the value printed that seems off?

 Print `userAge` again, but this time unwrap `userAge` using the force unwrap operator.
 */


//:  Now use optional binding to unwrap `userAge`. If `userAge` has a value, print it to the console.

 ### Exercise - Functions and Optionals

  If an app asks for a user's age, it may be because the app requires a user to be over a certain age to use some of the services it provides. Write a function called `checkAge` that takes one parameter of type `String`. The function should try to convert this parameter into an `Int` value and then check if the user is over 18 years old. If he/she is old enough, print "Welcome!", otherwise print "Sorry, but you aren't old enough to use our app." If the `String` parameter cannot be converted into an `Int` value, print "Sorry, something went wrong. Can you please re-enter your age?" Call the function and pass in `userAgeInput` below as the single parameter. Then call the function and pass in a string that can be converted to an integer.
  */
 let userAgeInput: String = "34e"

/*:
 Go back and update your function to return the age as an integer. Will your function always return a value? Make sure your return type accurately reflects this. Call the function and print the return value.

 Imagine you are creating an app for making purchases. Write a function that will take in the name of an item for purchase as a `String` and will return the cost of that item as an optional `Double`. In the body of the function, check to see if the item is in stock by accessing it in the dictionary `stock`. If it is, return the price of the item by accessing it in the dictionary `prices`. If the item is out of stock, return `nil`. Call the function and pass in a `String` that exists in the dictionaries below. Print the return value.
 */
 var prices = ["Chips": 2.99, "Donuts": 1.89, "Juice": 3.99, "Apple": 0.50, "Banana": 0.25, "Broccoli": 0.99]
 var stock = ["Chips": 4, "Donuts": 0, "Juice": 12, "Apple": 6, "Banana": 6, "Broccoli": 3]
