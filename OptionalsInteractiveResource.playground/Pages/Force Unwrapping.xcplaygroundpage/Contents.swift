/*:
## Force Unwrapping

 Force unwrapping with the `!` operator does NOT check for nil before executing. **This is potentially dangerous behavior, and not recommended unless you are absolutely sure you will not find nil.**

//I donâ€™t have a dog
var nameOfDog: String? = nil

//I just got a dog, so now I can update my variable
nameOfDog = "Uncle Dan"

//I JUST set the value of nameOfDog to a non-nil String, so Iâ€™m SURE this will work.
print(nameOfDog!)

 ### Now you try!
 
- Experiment:
    - Create a variable to represent amount of cranberry juice in your water bottle.
    - Set the value to `nil`.
    - Force unwrap it, and see what happens! ðŸ¤ª

- Experiment:
Fix the error above using one of the unwrapping methods we have learned.
