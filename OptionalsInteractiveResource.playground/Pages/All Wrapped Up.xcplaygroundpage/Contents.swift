## All Wrapped Up

 ### What does it mean for our optional’s value to be wrapped?
 Think about our gift box example. Before you open your gift box, your `present` is wrapped. This means we don’t know what it is, or if there is even a present at all. In Swift, we have to treat the contents of optional values as wrapped, and check if they contain values (rather than `nil`) before we can use them. In other words, using optionals requires _unwrapping._

 ---
 ### How can we handle optionals?
Lots of ways!
- Nil coalescing
- If let
- Guard let
- Force unwrapping
- If/else
- Optional chaining

 You’ll explore each of these on the subsequent pages.
